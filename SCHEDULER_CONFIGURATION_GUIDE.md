# Trading Strategy Scheduler Configuration Guide
# ==============================================

## üöÄ Overview

The trading system now includes an advanced scheduler that automatically executes different trading strategies at optimal frequencies:

### Strategy Types & Frequencies

1. **Day Trading** (High Frequency)
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes during market hours
   - Focus: Gap analysis, breakout patterns, scalping opportunities
   - Execution Window: 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST
   - Pre-market: Enabled for gap analysis

2. **Short Selling** (Frequent Monitoring)  
   - Frequency: Every 30 minutes during market hours
   - Focus: Overbought conditions, resistance rejections, bearish divergence
   - Execution Window: 9:15 AM - 4:00 PM IST (includes post-market)
   - Post-market: Enabled for end-of-day analysis

3. **Short Term** (Regular Intervals)
   - Frequency: Every 2 hours during extended hours
   - Focus: Swing trading signals, trend following
   - Execution Window: 9:15 AM, 11:15 AM, 1:15 PM, 3:15 PM, 5:15 PM IST
   - Pre/Post market: Both enabled

4. **Long Term** (Daily Analysis)
   - Frequency: Once daily after market close
   - Focus: Comprehensive trend analysis, position evaluation
   - Execution Time: 4:00 PM IST
   - Weekend: Enabled for research

MAX_CONCURRENT_STRATEGIES=3             # Maximum parallel executions
STRATEGY_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=15             # Maximum execution time per strategy

## üìä Frequency Optimization Guidelines

### High-Frequency Strategies (Day Trading & Short Selling)
- **Optimal Range**: 5-30 minutes
- **Considerations**: 
  - Market volatility (increase frequency during high volatility)
  - System resources (reduce if performance issues)
  - Signal quality (monitor hit rates)

### Medium-Frequency Strategies (Short Term)  
- **Optimal Range**: 1-4 hours
- **Considerations**:
  - Market trends (increase during trending markets)
  - Signal persistence (ensure signals remain valid)
  - Resource efficiency (balance with other strategies)

### Low-Frequency Strategies (Long Term)
- **Optimal Range**: Daily to weekly
- **Considerations**:
  - Market regime (daily during volatile periods)
  - Computational intensity (comprehensive analysis takes time)
  - Signal validity (long-term signals change slowly)

## üîß Performance Tuning Recommendations

### Based on Backtest Results

1. **Day Trading** (185 signals, 94.6% quality rate)
   - Recommended: 5-minute frequency during high volatility
   - Recommended: 10-minute frequency during low volatility
   - Peak hours: 9:15-11:00 AM, 2:00-3:30 PM

2. **Short Selling** (14 signals, 78.6% quality rate)
   - Recommended: 30-minute frequency (sufficient for quality signals)
   - Focus: End-of-day screening (3:00-4:00 PM)
   - Sector rotation: Increase frequency during sector peaks

3. **Short Term** (Historical average ~40 signals/day)
   - Recommended: 2-hour frequency for optimal coverage
   - Pre-market: 8:00 AM for gap preparation
   - Post-market: 5:00 PM for next-day preparation

4. **Long Term** (18 signals/month average)
   - Recommended: Daily execution sufficient
   - Weekend analysis: Enabled for research and planning

## üìà Dynamic Frequency Adjustment

### Market Volatility-Based Scaling
```python
# Low Volatility (VIX < 20)
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=10        # Reduce frequency
SHORT_SELLING_FREQUENCY=60      # Longer intervals

# High Volatility (VIX > 30)  
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=5         # Maximum frequency
SHORT_SELLING_FREQUENCY=15      # Frequent monitoring
```

### Market Hours Optimization
```python
# Peak Trading Hours (9:15-11:00 AM, 2:00-3:30 PM)
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=5         # Maximum frequency

# Lunch Hours (11:00 AM-2:00 PM)
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=15        # Reduced frequency
```

## üö® Alert Configuration

### Performance Monitoring
- Success Rate Alerts: <80% success rate
- Execution Time Alerts: >5 minutes execution time
- Resource Alerts: >90% CPU/Memory usage

### Strategy-Specific Alerts
- Day Trading: >10 concurrent signals (potential overtrading)
- Short Selling: No signals for >2 hours during market hours
- Long Term: Analysis failure for >1 day

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Gradual Rollout
Start with conservative frequencies and gradually optimize:
```bash
# Week 1: Conservative
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=15
SHORT_SELLING_FREQUENCY=60

# Week 2: Standard  
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=10
SHORT_SELLING_FREQUENCY=30

# Week 3+: Optimized
DAY_TRADING_FREQUENCY=5
SHORT_SELLING_FREQUENCY=30
```

### 2. Resource Monitoring
- Monitor CPU/Memory usage
- Track execution times
- Monitor database performance
- Watch API rate limits

### 3. Quality Control
- Monitor signal hit rates
- Track false positive rates
- Review execution statistics daily
